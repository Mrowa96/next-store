## Information for reviewer

- I added few tests, but not for everything, because of lack of time
- I decided to went with sqlite database for cart storage after talking to Marcin Jezierski who wanted to have those information stored somehow.
  - This unfortunately created situation where we need to store product information in db, so we have mix of some data from fakestoreapi and some from our db. But for some demo app I think is fine.
- I'm storing cart id in HttpOnly cookie. In normal application it won't be the case ofc.
